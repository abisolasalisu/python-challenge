Unit 3 | Assignment - Py Me Up, Charlie
Background
Well... you've made it!

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete 2 of 4 Python Challenges. Which ones you choose are completely your choice. In fact, feel encouraged to complete them all if you can muster the time.

Each of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

Before You Begin
Create a new GitHub repo called python-challenge. Then, clone it to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for 2 of the 4 Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the 2 challenges that you have chosen to complete: PyBank, PyPoll, PyBoss, or PyParagraph.

Inside of each folder that you just created, add a new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

Push the above changes to GitHub.
